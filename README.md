README for Acute Kidney Illness Prediction System
Project Overview
This project is a software engineering group endeavor aimed at developing and deploying a real-time predictive system for acute kidney illness. The system utilizes a Random Forest (RF) machine learning model to analyze patient information and test results, providing rapid alerts to medical teams. The deployment is managed on Kubernetes, ensuring scalability and reliability, with HL7 messages being the primary source of data input.

Key Features
Real-Time Data Processing: Analyzes incoming HL7 messages containing patient information and test results.
Acute Kidney Illness Prediction: Uses an RF model to predict the likelihood of acute kidney illness.
Rapid Alert System: Alerts medical teams within 3 seconds of detection.
Scalable Infrastructure: Deployed on Kubernetes for efficient scaling and management.
High Availability: Designed to be resilient and continuously operational.
System Architecture
Briefly describe the architecture of the system, including the RF model, data processing pipeline, Kubernetes deployment, and alert mechanism.
